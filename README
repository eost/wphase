## Dependencies

> gcc, gfortran
> rdseed 
> python 
> for MacOS users, it is necessary to install Coreutils
  which provide GNU Core Utilities. This can be done using 
  fink,macports or homebrew 
> (optional; for graphical output) python modules: Numpy, Matplotlib, Basemap.
> (optional; for graphical output) GMT4

## Building/Installing 

Add the following environnement variables to the '.tcshrc' file
in your home directory (or alternativelly '.cshrc'/'.bashrc' depending
on the shell you are using):

setenv WPHASE_HOME 'path to W-phase inversion directory' 
setenv GF_PATH     'path to Green's Functions data base' 
setenv RDSEED      'path to the rdseed executable'

(optional, see bellow) setenv ETOPOFILE 'path to ETOPO netCDF file'

We strongly advice to separate the ${WPHASE_HOME} directory
(i.e. the directory containing "bin" and "src") from the run
directories (i.e. containing data, and output files). This is
to make easier further updates. A good idea could be also to 
add ${WPHASE_HOME}/bin path to the $PATH of your shell.

Before compiling, 

- If you are using 32 bits libraries on a 64 architecture, 
  please add the flag '-m32' to OPTFLAG. 

- Be sure the environment variables described above are assigned.

Once all is ready, a simple 'make' or 'make -B' in $WPHASE_HOME/src/ 
should then build the whole package.

OPTIONAL; to include the topography/bathymetry in the grid-search
graphical output.

## Using ETOPO01 Global Relief Model

ETOPO01 is a 1 arc-minute global relief model of the Earth's surface
provided by Amante et al. (2009):
http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html

If Basemap is installed, you can optionally draw ETOPO01 topography and
bathymetry. To do so, the path to the ETOPO01 netCDF file must be
assigned to the environment variable $ETOPOFILE which can be
done in your .tcshrc fil (or .bachrc, .cshrc, etc.). The make_grids.py
script have been fully tested for grid-registered netCDF file of the
ETOPO1 bedrock file available at:
http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/data/bedrock/grid_registered/netcdf/ETOPO1_Bed_g_gmt4.grd.gz
